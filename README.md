# Board Game: Tactical Tic-Tac-Toe

Game link(without AI) (https://anar-sixeliyev.github.io/TTT/)

## Description

Tactical Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategic board game that introduces a new twist to the traditional tic-tac-toe gameplay. In this game, players engage in tactical decision-making and strategic planning to outsmart their opponents. The game incorporates a matrix-like board structure where each move determines the area where the opponent can play next.

### Gameplay Rules

1. The game begins with Player X making the first move.
2. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on one of the available positions within a "little table" on the board.
3. The position where a player puts their mark determines the area where the opponent can play next. For example, if Player X marks the up-left corner of a little table, Player O must play within that specific little table.
4. The game continues, with players placing marks within the designated little table based on the opponent's previous move.
5. If a little table becomes full, a player can put their mark on any available position of another little table of their choice.
6. The game ends when a player wins by getting three marks in a row, column, or diagonal within a little table, or when all little tables are full without a winner.

## Motivation

This project aims to design and develop an engaging board game that offers players an opportunity to exercise their tactical and strategic thinking abilities. Additionally, the project focuses on exploring different AI approaches, including heuristic algorithms, tree-traversal algorithms (such as minimax and alpha-beta pruning), adversarial search algorithms, and potentially advanced techniques like machine learning or neural networks, to enhance the game's AI opponent.

## Project Goals

- Design and develop a fully functional board game with intuitive gameplay mechanics.
- Implement an AI opponent capable of challenging human players and providing a dynamic gameplay experience.
- Explore various AI techniques, including heuristic algorithms, minimax, alpha-beta pruning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and potentially machine learning algorithms or neural networks.
- Conduct research to optimize the AI opponent's decision-making capabilities and adaptability during gameplay.
- Gather gameplay data through AI self-play or human player data to support AI training and evaluation.

## Target Audience

This project benefits both board game enthusiasts and researchers interested in AI and game design. Board game enthusiasts can enjoy a unique gaming experience that combines tactical decision-making with strategic planning. Researchers can gain insights into the implementation of various AI algorithms and techniques within the context of board games.

## Anticipated Risks

- Algorithmic Complexity: Implementing sophisticated AI algorithms may pose challenges in terms of computational resources and efficiency.
- Scalability: Ensuring the game and AI can handle increasing complexity and larger board sizes without performance degradation.
- AI Decision-Making Biases: Addressing potential biases or imbalances in AI decision-making to maintain fairness and provide a balanced gameplay experience.

## Schedule and Costs

The project is expected to be completed within 11 weeks, considering hardware limitations, available tools, and dataset collection requirements. The costs associated with the project are primarily related to personal time investment and potential hardware upgrades.

## Midterm Results

By the midterm stage, significant progress is anticipated in several areas:

- Completion of core game mechanics and rules.
- Initial implementation of AI opponent prototypes using heuristic algorithms and basic search techniques.
- Conducting preliminary playtesting sessions to gather feedback and refine the game mechanics.
- Research progress on AI algorithms and techniques suitable for the game.

## Final Demonstration

The final demonstration will showcase the culmination of the project,
